## Installation ##

Install node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/download/) for your operating system. Then install *dust* via the node package manager

	sudo npm install -g dustlayer

Then you are good to go, typical you want to setup the tools:

	dust setup

	[... once this is done ...]

	dust test # shows if everything is in place


 Download a tutorial to check if your setup works: 

 	cd ~
	dust tutorials # list tutorial code and select one for download
	# cd into the directory and run dust compile	
	dust compile # compiles the C64 code and runs it in the C64 Emulator

or open the project in Sublime first and build from context menu 

 	# cd into the directory 
 	sublime .

Then hit CMD-B - if nothing happens, you need to select one time the appropriate build system in Tools->Build System->C64-6502, then hit again CMD-B
